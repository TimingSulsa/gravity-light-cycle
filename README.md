### 1. Abstract
This study reinterprets gravity and the evolution of the universe by defining time as a physical entity identical to 'motion.' Based on the 'Observability Window' concept, this paper analyzes time dilation phenomena in Special and General Relativity. It posits that black holes represent a 'frozen past' beyond the observation limit, while superluminal motion represents an unobservable 'leap into the future.' Furthermore, gravity is defined as a thermodynamic restoring force acting to resolve spatiotemporal velocity imbalances. The study argues that once the universe reaches a state of complete temporal equilibrium (maximum entropy), gravity ceases to exist, leaving only a 'Chemical State' of pure interactions. Finally, it proposes a new cyclic cosmological model where inevitable quantum fluctuations in this static state resurrect motion and gravity, triggering a new universe.

### 2. Introduction
* **Background:** The definition of time remains one of physics' most profound conundrums. While Einstein's theory of relativity integrated time and space, a unified explanation regarding the origin of time's flow and the fate of gravity at the universe's end remains elusive.
* **Objective:** This paper aims to construct an intuitive and logical model explaining the origin of gravity, its extinction, and the cyclic nature of the universe, grounded in the premise that "Time is Motion."

### 3. Main Body

#### 3.1. Time-Motion Equivalence and Observability Limits
* **Hypothesis:** Time is not an independent dimension but is defined by the 'motion' of matter and energy itself.
* **The Observability Window:** An observer perceives the universe only through a finite window of 'the present.'
    * **Boundary of the Past (Black Holes):** A state where motion is extremely retarded or halted by gravity. Information cannot escape, appearing to the observer as a 'forever frozen residual image of the past,' thus falling outside the observability range.
    * **Boundary of the Future (Speed of Light):** A state where motion becomes extremely fast ($c$). The object transcends the observer's time axis, leaping into a future point. Velocities exceeding light speed break causality and thus vanish from the observability range.

#### 3.2. Thermodynamic Reinterpretation of Gravity
* **Definition of Gravity:** Gravity is interpreted not merely as the curvature of space, but as a natural restoring force attempting to resolve imbalances in 'time velocity' (or density of motion) within spacetime.
* **Mechanism:**
    * The tendency of flow from areas of fast time (low gravity, empty space) to areas of slow time (high gravity, near mass) manifests as gravitational pull.
    * This is analogous to the laws of thermodynamics, where energy flows from high to low potential to achieve equilibrium.

#### 3.3. The End of the Universe and Dissolution of Gravity
* **Reaching Equilibrium:** In the distant future, after cosmic expansion and the complete evaporation of black holes (via Hawking Radiation), all matter will decay and be uniformly distributed.
* **Extinction of Gravity:** As mass density differences disappear, the imbalance in time flow also vanishes. When the velocity of time becomes uniform across the cosmos (Time Equilibrium), the restoring force—gravity—loses its basis for existence and dissolves.

#### 3.4. The Chemical State and Cyclic Rebirth
* **The Chemical State:** A universe without gravity consists only of massless particles (like photons) and fundamental interactions (e.g., electromagnetic force). This is a state of pure energy where macroscopic concepts of time or distance become meaningless.
* **Trigger for the Cycle:** According to the Uncertainty Principle, even in a state of perfect stasis, minute 'motion' (Quantum Fluctuations) inevitably occurs.
* **Rebirth:** This microscopic motion creates a new imbalance in time flow $\rightarrow$ generates spacetime distortion (Gravity) $\rightarrow$ leads to the inflation of a new universe (Big Bang).

### 4. Conclusion
By reducing time to physical motion, this study provides a consistent logical framework for explaining time dilation in relativity and cosmological evolution. Specifically, interpreting gravity as a 'process of equilibration for time imbalance' is significant as it connects the extinction of gravity with the potential for a cyclic universe. This suggests a new philosophical and scientific bridge between Roger Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) and thermodynamic entropy theories.

### < Process of Thought Experiment >

* **Basis:** Based on the physical principle that gravity and velocity alter time.
* **Definition:** In this thought experiment, time is defined as "motion."
* **Observation:** An observer in the present timeframe observes objects with slow motion (e.g., Black Holes) and fast motion (e.g., Muons).

1.  **When velocity is slow, the timeframe approaches the *Past* (Black Holes).**
    * It is predicted that if motion stops or reverses, the object would be observed as disappearing.
    * Observing the actual past is impossible as it exceeds the observable time range (e.g., one cannot observe an object reversing its age).

2.  **When velocity is fast, the timeframe approaches the *Future* (Muons).**
    * A muon from the past approaches the observer's current timeframe, resulting in an observed extension of its lifespan.
    * Observing the actual future is also impossible as it exceeds the observable time range (e.g., one cannot observe the accelerated aging process ahead of time).

3.  **The reason the speed of light is observed as constant is that any velocity exceeding it transcends the observable time range and disappears into the future.**

4.  **Gravity can be viewed as a force attempting to restore equilibrium to a temporal imbalance.**

5.  **Once temporal equilibrium is eventually achieved, gravity will cease to exist.**

6.  **The universe will enter a "Chemical State" where only forces other than gravity exist.**

7.  **Within this Chemical State, motion re-emerges, causing temporal imbalance and regenerating gravity, thus leading to a Cyclic Universe.**
